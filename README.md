I've been interested in programming since I was a schoolboy. I attended courses on website creation and studied HTML, used JavaScript. In high school, he began studying Java on his own. During my studies at the college, I became interested in Python. I was offered to take courses in this language. I agreed and started learning this language.

I like working with Python code, as it is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. Python has a simple and understandable syntax, which makes it ideal for beginners in programming.
